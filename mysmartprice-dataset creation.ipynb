With its vibrant design and a camera setup boasting a hefty 200MP main lens and an 8MP ultra-wide snapper, along with a 16MP selfie shooter - the Note 13 Pro caters to photography buffs. Just watch out for noise in low light and occasional inconsistencies in skin tone during portrait mode. Powered by the Snapdragon 7s Gen 3 SoC, it cruises through daily tasks and gaming with ease. Plus, its 5100mAh battery keeps you going strong. And hey, it still rocks a headphone jack and IR transmitter, which is a nice bonus. However, its reliance on Android 13 may deter some users, especially given the year is 2024. Nonetheless, if you're seeking a phone that delivers in terms of cameras, performance, and display quality, the Note 13 Pro is the one for you.\n",

The colours on the display aren't particularly vibrant or punchy but lean more towards a neutral approach. For photography, the Vivo T3x is equipped with a 50MP primary camera and a 2MP depth sensor on the back. The photos taken with this smartphone are good but sometimes images lack adequate details. The dynamic range is limited, which may be a drawback for some users. Regardless, for the price, the photos are impressive.   Low-light performance is average. On the front, it has an 8MP selfie camera that captures natural-looking photos. The Vivo T3x is powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 6 Gen 1 SoC, delivering solid performance. The device handles multitasking and heavy gaming without significant heat issues. It runs on FunTouchOS 14, based on Android 14, out of the box. While the phone comes with some bloatware, apps can be uninstalled if unnecessary. The Vivo T3x boasts a 6000mAh battery and includes a 44W fast charger in the box, providing impressive battery life. So, if you're looking for a smartphone under Rs 15,000 with a sleek design, excellent battery life, and reliable performance, the Vivo T3x is a great option to consider.\n",

Despite some minor issues, this is a solid upgrade from last year and could be the right choice if you can overlook the bloatware.\n",

      "The Samsung Galaxy S24 is a compact phone featuring a 6.1-inch AMOLED display with uniform bezels. It's powered by the Exynos 2400 SoC, which excels at multitasking. The phone handles any task with ease and performs well in gaming. The 120Hz refresh rate enhances the display, making it buttery smooth. After extended gaming sessions, it doesn't heat up excessively. However, the phone has a 4000mAh battery, which is quite small compared to other budget and mid-range smartphones. Despite this, the battery life is good, lasting almost 24 hours with light usage. The phone supports 25W charging, which is relatively low, and unfortunately, it doesn't include a charger in the box. Regarding the camera, the phone boasts a 50MP primary camera, a 10MP telephoto camera, and a 12MP ultra-wide camera on the rear. The primary and telephoto cameras perform well, but the ultra-wide camera still lacks autofocus. Low-light photography is decent but can sometimes be grainy. On the front, there's a 12MP selfie camera that works effectively. Overall, the Samsung Galaxy S24 is a compact phone with strong performance, impressive cameras, and good battery life.\n",

      "The Moto G64 aims to offer an affordable device without cutting too many corners. And it succeeds in that aspect to a large extent. If you go for the higher-end variant, you get 256GB storage and 12GB RAM for under Rs 16,000, which is impressive. What stands out is the design, the general performance, the camera, and the large battery size. The user interface is also simple.     But then Motorola is restricting Android updates to just one more version. Is this the best display one can get on a phone? No, nor is it a device centred around gaming. But then, given the price, it ticks some of the more important boxes quite nicely. If one goes by pricing, its biggest rival would be the Realme P1, which has more to offer on the gaming front. Get the Moto G64 if you want a phone that does the basics well and your budget is limited to Rs 14,000-Rs 16,000.\n",

Powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 7 Gen 1 AE SoC, this phone handles everyday tasks effortlessly. However, you might experience heating issues during intensive gaming sessions with titles like BGMI and Call of Duty: Mobile. While the camera performs well overall, the portrait photography feature may disappoint some users. Considering all these aspects, the Motorola Edge 50 attempts to cater to a wide range of user needs. However, compromises may be necessary for photography and fast charging.\n",

Despite the lack of a telephoto camera on the iPhone 15, its computational photography prowess helps it be one of the best camera phones for the price point. At 20W, the charging speeds are still archaic, but its battery life is surprisingly good for a phone its size.    The integration of iOS 16 ensures a smooth and secure user experience. The Dynamic Island is a useful addition compared to the plain old notch on the display. However, the absence of a high-refresh-rate display might be a drawback for users accustomed to smoother animations.

      "The Oppo F25 Pro packs a punch with solid performance, decent cameras for its price, and a battery that claims to be up and running for 16 to 17 hours. Its 6.7-inch AMOLED display with a speedy 120Hz refresh rate makes switching apps a breeze, while HDR 10+ support brings colours to life. Despite its rather ordinary design, the matte finish keeps fingerprints at bay. On the back, you'll find a 64MP main camera, an 8MP ultra-wide camera, and a 2MP macro shooter, with a 32MP selfie camera up front. Picture quality is alright, but watch out for the selfie cam - it might make your face a bit too smooth. At the helm of it is the MediaTek Dimensity 7050 SoC, the F25 Pro handles everyday tasks and light gaming effortlessly. However, be prepared for lacklustre performance especially on high-end games, as the processor is based on a three-year-old architecture. With ColorOS 14 on board, based on Android 14, there's plenty of room for customisation, the presence of pre-installed apps can clutter the experience. With the 5000mAh battery and 67W fast charger included in the package - all for a price that's well within Rs 25,000.\n",

      "The Redmi 13C 5G presents itself as a budget-friendly 5G smartphone featuring a glitzy back panel, a chipset that can perform daily tasks with ease, and commendable battery backup. Display-wise, users are treated to a 6.74-inch panel offering a 90Hz refresh rate. However, the display's waterdrop-style notch and thick bezels belong to a bygone era. On the rear, the phone is equipped with a 50MP AI camera alongside a 2MP depth camera, while a 5MP selfie camera graces the front. Picture quality is decent, however, if the camera is your main priority, you may have to look elsewhere. As for performance, the phone is fueled by the MediaTek Dimensity 6100+ SoC, which is adequate given its price point. While users might encounter occasional stutters and lags, these shouldn't significantly impede daily tasks. The device ships with a plethora of pre-installed apps, which can somewhat mar the software experience. Powering the device is a 5000mAh battery with support for up to 18W of charging. However, the inclusion of a 10W charging adapter in the box means full charging might take over two hours. That being said, if your primary considerations revolve around 5G connectivity, satisfactory performance, and an aesthetically appealing design without breaking the bank, the Redmi 13C 5G could very well be your go-to option.\n",

Unfortunately, the M15 has a water-drop notch for the selfie camera, which some users might not prefer. The phone is powered by the MediaTek Dimensity 6100+ SoC, providing smooth performance for everyday tasks. Casual games like Subway Surfers and Clash of Clans run well, but you may notice stuttering and lag with high-end games. The rear camera setup includes a 50MP primary camera, a 5MP secondary camera, and a 2MP camera. The front camera is a 13MP selfie shooter. While the image quality is good, it's not extraordinary, and low-light photography can be quite noisy. The phone has a 6000mAh battery and supports 25W charging, which is relatively slow for such a large battery. However, the battery life is impressive, lasting almost 24 hours with light to moderate usage. Therefore, if you're looking for a budget smartphone that excels in casual gaming, offers excellent battery life, and provides good photo quality, the M15 is a solid choice.\n",

      "The Vivo Y200 5G is a budget-friendly smartphone with a decent camera and an appealing design. Sporting a 6.67-inch AMOLED display with a 120Hz refresh rate, it offers an enjoyable viewing experience. The design features a matte finish with a glass back panel, which looks sleek and doesn't attract fingerprints. But it's not just a pretty face  -  powered by the Snapdragon 4 Gen 2 SoC, this bad boy handles everyday tasks with ease and even lets you kick back with some casual gaming. With a hefty 4800mAh battery and 44W fast charging support, you're set for a day of uninterrupted use. Now, let's talk about the camera setup. On the rear, there's a 64MP primary camera with OIS and a 2MP bokeh camera, accompanied by a smooth aura ring light for improved low-light photography. For selfies, there's a 16MP front camera that captures decent shots, although it sometimes smoothens the skin, giving it an unnatural look. Running on FuntouchOS 13 based on Android 13, the Vivo Y200 5G offers ample customisation options, albeit accompanied by some pre-installed apps you might not need. Nevertheless, if you're seeking a budget smartphone with a focus on camera performance, the Vivo Y200 5G is worth considering.\n",

      "The Xiaomi 14 is a compact phone with a very comfortable in-hand feel. Its glossy back panel is a fingerprint magnet, requiring constant cleaning. Despite this, the Xiaomi 14 is really attractive. The rich display quality and the 120Hz refresh rate enhance the viewing experience. The phone is powered by the latest chipset, the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 SoC. The phone is very smooth for everyday use, and the animations are excellent, which is impressive. However, when playing demanding games, the phone starts heating up within 30 minutes, which is not ideal for avid gamers. One of the standout features of this phone is its cameras. It boasts a 50MP primary camera, a 50MP telephoto camera, and a 50MP ultra-wide camera. On the front, there's a 32MP selfie camera. The Xiaomi 14 can take incredible pictures in all environments, and the low-light picture quality is also great. The device has a 4610mAh battery, which is not particularly impressive, but it supports a 90W hypercharger, fully charging the phone in 35 minutes, which is quite convenient. Considering all these factors, the Xiaomi 14 is an excellent phone for everyday users, but avid gamers might need to look elsewhere.\n",

If you're just looking for a phone that gets the job done without all the 5G hype, this one's not a bad shout at Rs. 7,999. With a generous 6.74-inch screen and a buttery-smooth 90Hz refresh rate, navigating this device feels like a breeze. This phone packs a MediaTek Helio G85 SoC, delivering respectable performance for your calling, messaging, and multimedia needs. Snap-happy users will find a 50MP main camera, a 2MP macro camera, and an 8MP selfie shooter at their disposal. While the picture quality gets the job done, it won't blow your socks off. Battery-wise, you've got a hefty 5000mAh unit that'll keep you going all day long. However, the inclusion of only a 10W charging adapter in the box means you'll be waiting a while for it to juice up fully. The only downside? It ships with Android 13 out-of-the-box in 2024, which might not sit well with some users. But if you're in the market for a smartphone that covers the essentials, the Redmi 13C 4G has your back.\n",

      "The Realme 12x closely resembles its older sibling, the Realme 12 Pro. While the Pro model boasts a vegan leather finish, the 12x comes with a plastic build. The Realme 12x features a 6.72-inch LCD display with a 120Hz refresh rate, offering a decent viewing experience for its price range. However, don't expect the vibrant colours of an AMOLED display. At the rear, the phone comes with a 50MP primary camera and a 2MP depth sensor, but it lacks an ultra-wide camera. Photos taken with the Realme 12x are sharp, though the colours tend to be on the warmer side. The 8MP front camera captures selfies with artificial skin tones but is still social-media ready. Low-light photography results in grainy and noisy images. Powered by the MediaTek Dimensity 6100+ SoC, the Realme 12x handles everyday tasks like calling, texting, social media, and casual browsing well. For heavy gaming, it can run titles like BGMI on HD graphics, but you might experience some stutters and lags. The device runs on Android 14 out-of-the-box, offering plenty of animations and customisation options. The Realme 12x includes a 5000mAh battery and comes with a 45W SUPERVOOC charger. It takes about 55 minutes to an hour to fully charge, and the battery can last a full day with light to moderate use. Considering its design, functionality, and impressive battery life, the Realme 12x is a solid choice for those seeking an affordable and stylish smartphone for everyday use.\n",

The Galaxy F54 features a 6.5-inch screen offering a 120Hz refresh rate, delivering vibrant colours for an immersive multimedia experience. On the rear, users will find a 108MP primary camera with OIS, an 8MP ultra-wide camera, and a 2MP macro shooter, capturing natural-looking photos with rich colors. For selfies, there's a 32MP front camera, delivering accurate skin tones. The Samsung Galaxy F54 is powered by the Exynos 1380 chipset, which effortlessly handles daily tasks such as multitasking, calling, and messaging, among others. The phone is also capable of running heavy games like BGMI and Call of Duty: Mobile, although it may tend to heat up after extended use. Running on One UI 5.1 based on Android 13, the device offers plenty of customisation options, although it does come with some bloatware, fortunately removable. With a robust 6000mAh battery and 25W fast charging support, the Galaxy F54 ensures long-lasting battery life, although it's worth noting that the charger is not included in the box.

The performance truly stands out. In terms of design, the Narzo 70 features a boxy shape with a glossy back finish, while the front sports a flat display. The bezels are relatively slim for this price range, which is a notable advantage. Although the design isn't innovative, the display quality is impressive for a phone in this segment. The phone has a substantial feel and is not particularly lightweight. It features a 50-megapixel AI camera alongside a 2-megapixel mono camera on the back, delivering decent photo quality. Unfortunately, the selfie camera struggles with capturing accurate skin tones. The Narzo 70 comes with a 5000mAh battery and a 45W charger in the box. While the battery life is seven to eight hours, which might not be exceptional, it is still reasonable.\n",

Sure, it's priced a bit steep, but hey, that's just the iPhone way in India. The titanium back panel looks fly, even though it's a total fingerprint magnet. Plus, the rounded edges of the phone make it very easy to hold without a case. Speaking of the display, users get a 6.7-inch OLED display with a 120Hz refresh rate, making watching videos and Netflix shows feel like a breeze. And let's not forget the cameras  -  a 48MP main, 12MP ultra-wide, and 12MP telephoto at the back, with a crisp 12MP selfie shooter up front. The 15 Pro Max will provide consistent results, with crisp details and ample dynamic range. The smartphone is powered by the Apple A17 Pro chip, making it a smooth operator. Whether scrolling through social media apps, casual browsing, texting, or playing intensive games, everything feels effortless. Sure, the phone might heat but a quick software update should sort that out. Battery life is impressive, providing nearly a full day of use, although charging speeds could be faster. And with iOS 17, customization options abound, allowing you to tailor the device to your liking. So, if you're willing to splash the cash, the iPhone 15 Pro Max is where it's at.\n",

      "The Samsung Galaxy S20 FE 5G looks exactly like its 4G model with no design changes. In terms of design, the S20 FE 5G has a very clean and minimal look with a plastic back panel. This phone is powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 865 SoC, which-- albeit slightly dated--handles day-to-day tasks with ease, including running heavy games like Call of Duty: Mobile. The S20 FE 5G runs on Samsung's One UI 3.1, which is based on Android 11. This device comes pre-loaded with numerous apps, though users can uninstall them based on their preferences. As for the display, there's a 6.5-inch Super AMOLED display that provides a natural look and accurate colours. While indoor brightness is satisfactory, outdoor visibility might be lacking.  Powering the device is a 4500mAh battery, supporting up to 25W of fast charging; disappointingly, it ships with a 15W charger. The camera setup includes a 12MP wide-angle camera, an 8MP telephoto camera, a 12MP ultra-wide camera at the back, and a 32MP selfie shooter at the front. Daylight captures are crisp and vibrant, though low-light performance is average. The Samsung Galaxy S20 FE 5G caters well to casual users seeking a 5G-enabled device for their daily usage despite its older processor, making it a suitable choice for their needs.\n",

      "The Redmi 12 is that affordable 5G kid on the block, offering decent bang for your buck. It packs in 5G compatibility, solid battery life, and a respectable display for its price tag. With a spacious 6.79-inch FHD+ LCD display rocking a smooth 90Hz refresh rate, your visuals are crisp and fluid indoors, though it might struggle a bit under bright sunlight. In the camera department, you're looking at a 50MP main shooter and a 2MP depth camera - no ultra-wide camera here, unfortunately. Selfie-wise, there's an 8MP front-facing camera. While it holds its own in well-lit conditions, low-light shots leave something to be desired. It's powered by the Snapdragon 4 Gen 2 SoC, chugging along smoothly for your everyday tasks but stumbling a bit when it comes to gaming. With a hearty 5000mAh battery, it's got the juice to keep you going through the day. It runs on MIUI 14, based on Android 13, but be prepared for a bit of bloatware out of the box. At Rs. 11,999, this 5G smartphone checks off most of the boxes, making it a worthy contender for budget-conscious buyers.\n",

      "At a starting price of Rs 66,999 (8GB RAM + 128GB storage), the OnePlus 10 Pro goes up against a host of premium devices in India. It brings a lot to the table - Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 chip, 80W fast charging support and the adapter ships with the phone, 6.7-inch QHD+ display, and 48-megapixel triple camera setup. Not to forget, the OxygenOS is here to stay and is a popular Android skin.      Some of the biggest strengths of the device are its performance, display, battery, and primary camera are among the best out there. Unfortunately, we can't say that for all sensors. The ultra-wide camera, in particular, doesn't impress. But, then, the missing IP rating is slightly a heartbreak. It's a feature that is always good to have. Not to forget, OnePlus will also need to tighten its update cycle for both OS and security updates. We also think that it's about time that OnePlus starts shipping a 512GB storage variant with its flagship phones.\n",

It features a 6.7-inch AMOLED display with a 120Hz refresh rate, offering a good viewing experience with smooth and fast animations. The phone is powered by a 5000mAh battery and comes with a 33W charger, easily lasting a day with moderate to heavy usage. The device runs on Android 12, which is disappointing since the latest version, Android 13, should be included. The Note 12 is equipped with the Qualcomm Snapdragon 4 Gen 1 SoC. It performs moderately well for day-to-day tasks, but games crash too frequently in gaming. The rear camera setup consists of a 48MP primary camera, an 8MP ultrawide camera, and a 2MP macro camera. Daylight shots are acceptable and have good colour accuracy, but the ultrawide camera could do with some improvements. On the front, there's a 13MP selfie camera with various beauty modes and filters, producing consistently nice skin tones. Considering these factors, the Redmi Note 12 is a good smartphone with a solid design, decent performance, and impressive cameras.\n",

The OnePlus Nord CE 4 has a robust 5500mAh battery and a 100W SUPERVOOC charger. The phone can last at least 24 hours with light to moderate use.

The image quality of the wide camera is impressive, but the ultra-wide camera's results are too narrow compared to other smartphones. The Pixel 7 is powered by the Tensor G2 SoC, which handles everyday tasks smoothly. However, extended gaming sessions can cause the back panel to heat up.

Its 6.72-inch LCD display boasts a 120Hz refresh rate and holds its own, although it tends to falter under direct sunlight. Powered by the MediaTek Dimensity 6100+ SoC, it breezes through light tasks but falls short for hardcore gaming enthusiasts.

When it comes to photography, it sports a 108MP primary camera alongside a 2MP portrait camera on the rear, complemented by an 8MP selfie snapper. The resulting photos are decent, perfect for social media sharing, with colours that pop naturally. Equipped with a 5000mAh battery with support for 45W fast charging, it can easily last a full day with moderate usage or endure around 6-7 hours of heavy usage. For the accident-prone, investing in a sturdy case is advisable to prevent unfortunate slips. Overall, the Realme 12 5G exudes budget-friendly sass while delivering a commendable blend of style and camera prowess.\n",

However, in low-lighting conditions, the front-facing camera captures average images. Also, the device lacks a microSD card slot. Overall, the Motorola Edge 40 is a decent smartphone at Rs 29,999, considering that you get an OLED 144Hz display, Dimensity 8020 SoC, up to 68W fast charging, 5G, and a 50MP dual-camera setup.\n",

It delivers adequate picture quality during the day, albeit with a tendency to over-brighten faces. However, its edge detection capabilities leave room for improvement. The performance from the Qualcomm Snapdragon 4 Gen 2 SoC isn't the best in class, so, If performance and gaming rank high on your priority list, you might want to explore other options. Nevertheless, considering its price point, you get a really nice 120Hz AMOLED display along with good dual stereo speakers. The UI is decent but keep an eye out for bloatware on this smartphone.\n",

      "The Moto G24 Power boasts a clean user interface, impressive battery life, and an IP52 rating for splashes. However, it falls short in the 5G compatibility department. Display-wise, its 6.56-inch IPS LCD screen offers a 90Hz refresh rate, though its performance under bright sunlight is somewhat lacklustre for its price range. On the camera front, users are equipped with a 50MP main camera, a 2MP macro snapper, along with a 16MP selfie shooter. While the camera setup delivers decent results, it may not satisfy users seeking crisp details, and the selfie camera tends to overly smooth the skin, yielding an artificial appearance. Powered by the MediaTek Helio G85 chipset, the Moto G24 Power suits regular usage but may struggle with high-end gaming demands. Thankfully, its Android 14-based My UX interface provides a nearly stock Android experience with minimal pre-installed apps, coupled with extensive customization options. The smartphone is powered by a 6000mAh battery that should last for an entire day. So, if you're okay with skipping the 5G hype and can live with some average camera action, the Moto G24 Power could be your budget-friendly companion.\n",

      "The Vivo V27 looks aesthetically pleasing and is UV-reactive, changing the colours under glaring sunlight. When indoors, it returns to its normal colour. It changes colours like a chameleon. The device boasts a 6.78-inch, curved AMOLED display with a 120Hz refresh rate. The display is highly responsive and buttery smooth. However, this phone lacks stereo speakers, which can be a dealbreaker for many. The phone features a MediaTek Dimensity 7200 SoC, which performs well in day-to-day usage. Gaming on this phone is also good, but you may notice occasional lags and stutters when playing intensive games. The phone packs a 4600mAh battery and comes with a 66W charging adapter. The charging speeds are decent. The Vivo V27 runs on FunTouchOS 13, based on Android 13, which comes with bloatware. The V27 offers good customisation options for the home screen and lock screen. At the rear, there's a 50MP main camera with OIS, an 8MP ultra-wide camera, and a 2MP super macro camera. On the front, there's a 50MP camera with autofocus for selfies. The main camera on this phone is brilliant; however, the ultra-wide and super macro cameras need some improvement. The front camera clicks selfies that can be posted on social media without any editing. Therefore, if you're in the market for an aesthetically pleasing device that changes colours like a chameleon, and you want an awesome battery with great cameras, then the Vivo V27 stands as an ideal choice.\n",

Expect true-to-life images without over-processing. Performance-wise, the phone houses the MediaTek Dimensity 8200 SoC, handling everyday tasks with ease, from gaming to multitasking, all without any hiccups. And with a rather decent 4600mAh battery, you'll go all day without a hitch. Oh, and say goodbye to bloatware - FunTouch 13 based on Android 13 lets you declutter your phone.

      "If you're in the market for a smartphone suited for everyday use such as scrolling through social media apps, light gaming, and browsing, then the Vivo Y28 presents itself as a budget-friendly 5G option worth considering. Display-wise, users get a 6.56-inch IPS LCD screen, which falls within the average spectrum. The device is powered by the MediaTek Dimensity 6020 SoC, which provides slightly lacklustre performance when compared to some of its peers. When it comes to photography, it boasts a 50MP main camera and a 2MP depth camera on the rear, accompanied by an 8MP selfie shooter. While the images captured by the phone are satisfactory and somewhat true-to-life, selfie enthusiasts may notice a smoothing effect applied to the skin. The phone runs on FuntouchOS 13, based on Android 13, which comes with a lot of bloatware. They can send you those pesky notifications you didn't sign up for. The phone houses a 5000mAh battery, which will last for over a day with light usage. So, if you're in the market for an affordable 5G smartphone with standard capabilities, the Vivo Y28 5G stands as a solid contender.\n",

The cover screen could be more practical as well. To sum up, the Tecno Phantom V Flip may not the best in its price range, but it offers an excellent value for those looking to make a statement or hang up on calls in style. The Moto Razr 40 is another alternative, but has its own drawbacks.\n",

      "The Galaxy Note 10 Plus is among the best high-end phones you can buy right now. Apart from the missing headphone jack, there's nothing else that I could think of, being particularly bad on the phone. It has an eye-catching design, it feels thinner than it actually is, and it has the best display in the smartphone business, as of 2019. The Exynos 9825 brings speed and smoothness, and One UI is one of the nicest feeling software in the business. All four cameras on the phone are excellent. While the Note 10 Plus can't quite reach the level and clarity of the P30 Pro's camera in low-light conditions, it more than makes up for it in the video recording capability. The phone has dozens of useful features, including Samsung Pay and water resistance. Battery life is good, too, but not among the best in the business. All-in-all, it is one of the best phones released in 2019.\n",

The Poco C65 offers a good daily performance with a battery that should last up to a day. There's 18W charging support as well, is about as much as the market standard. The 90Hz refresh rate of the display could have been higher, considering many budget smartphones offer a 120Hz screen these days.

If you're on a tight budget and are looking for a smartphone strictly under the Rs 10,000 price point, then Poco C65 is one of the best options to consider.

This variant gets 8GB RAM with 128GB storage, which sadly is not expandable. The Super AMOLED display gets 120Hz refresh rate support which is slick and you'll love playing games on it. The OS still has bloatware which is not ideal and the primary camera at the back is a mixed bag. And finally, the 4500mAh battery has a lot to thank for the 65W charging speed for quick juice up.

On the back, you'll find a 50MP primary AI camera and a 2MP depth camera, while the front features a 5MP selfie camera. The image colours are saturated, but there's a noticeable amount of noise. The overall image quality is acceptable, though nothing exceptional. Powered by the MediaTek Dimensity 6100+ SoC, the Poco M6 performs well, handling everyday and heavy tasks with a few restrictions. It has a 5000mAh battery that supports 18W charging, although the phone has a 10W charging adapter. The battery life lasts an entire day with light to moderate usage. In summary, the Poco M6 is a solid choice in the budget segment.\n",

Its Snapdragon 695 SoC is a bit dated, but it can handle light tasks just fine. Plus, with My UX based on Android 14, the interface is clean and clutter-free. While the phone includes a 20W charging adapter in the box, it's only compatible with 18W charging, which may confuse buyers.

Powered by the MediaTek Helio G85 SoC, the phone handles everyday tasks such as calling, texting, scrolling through Instagram, and watching YouTube videos well, with only minor lags and stutters. However, intensive games like BGMI and Call of Duty: Mobile can only be played at the lowest settings and crashed multiple times during our testing. In contrast, casual games like Subway Surfers and 2048 run smoothly on this device. The phone has a 50MP primary camera and 0.08MP secondary camera on the back, and an 8MP front camera for selfies. The photo quality is average but sufficient for basic needs. It is equipped with a 5000mAh battery that supports 15W charging, which is relatively slow. The device runs on Funtouch OS 14, based on Android 14, and can feel somewhat laggy at times. Overall, considering its features and performance, the Vivo Y18 is a solid choice in the under-10K price segment.\n",

      "The Google Pixel 8 Pro features a matte body finish that makes it easy to hold, and the device feels quite compact. It has a 6.7-inch OLED display that remains bright even under glaring sunlight. The display offers a 120Hz refresh rate, ensuring smooth animations and an impressive user experience. Powered by the Tensor G3 SoC, the phone boasts significant AI capabilities and handles everyday tasks efficiently. However, its gaming performance may not meet expectations, as the phone tends to heat up during extended gameplay sessions. The Pixel 8 Pro has a 50MP primary camera and a 48MP ultra-wide camera. While the primary camera shows minimal improvements over the Pixel 7 Pro, the tones are cooler. The phone excels in low-light photography, which is a notable advantage. It has a 5050mAh battery and supports 30W charging, although the charger is not included in the box. Running on Android 14, the 8 Pro offers a pure Android experience. Therefore, if you are looking for a smartphone with excellent camera capabilities, a stock Android experience, and advanced AI features, the Pixel 8 Pro is a strong contender.\n",

      "Oppo A79 5G's highlight reel includes a unique rear panel texture, flat edge design and a 5,000mAh battery. When you have a deeper look, things get a little interesting. The OPPO A79 5G is powered by MediaTek 6020 SoC, which is also the chipset that powers the Lava Blaze 2 5G, which is about half its price. Its 50MP dual rear camera setup is decent for both, night and day shots, and the display is also decently responsive at 90Hz.    Oppo A79 5G is priced slightly on the higher side at Rs 19,999, so those open to options are recommended to go for realme Narzo 60 5G, which is priced slightly lower at Rs 15,999 and comes with slightly higher specifications on paper, like a Super AMOLED display, a 64MP primary rear camera, and a 16MP front camera.\n",

      "The OnePlus 12R closely resembles its older sibling, the OnePlus 12. It features a glossy back panel that does get covered in fingerprints easily. Still, the phone is comfortable to hold and well-built. This phone features a 6.78-inch ProXDR display with a 120Hz refresh rate. The display is bright and offers a great viewing experience. Powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 SoC, which is slightly older, the chipset handles everyday tasks and heavy gaming efficiently. If you're looking for a smartphone that balances performance and gaming, the 12R is a strong choice. At the back, the 12R boasts a 50MP primary camera, an 8MP ultra-wide camera, and a 2MP macro camera. The photos are crisp and detailed, but if you prioritise advanced photography features, you might prefer the OnePlus 12. The phone has a 5500mAh battery and comes with an 80W charging adapter. You can expect a full day of battery life with light to moderate use. Overall, the OnePlus 12R offers a flagship-level experience at a more affordable price.\n",

Games like BGMI and Call of Duty: Mobile run smoothly, adding to the entertainment value. The stereo speakers on the S21 FE produce excellent sound quality, which is a bonus. In terms of battery life, the phone houses a 4500mAh battery, lasting almost a day with light to moderate usage. Regarding the cameras, there's a 12MP main camera with OIS, an 8MP telephoto camera, and a 12MP ultra-wide camera on the rear. For selfies, there's a 32MP front-facing camera. Daylight shots are vibrant and detailed, but the ultra-wide camera lacks autofocus. The selfie camera captures natural photos with consistent skin tones. Low-light photography on this device brightens images, sometimes excessively. Overall, the Galaxy S21 FE ticks most boxes with a few drawbacks. If you're looking for a smartphone with solid performance, a premium design, and excellent battery life, then the S21 FE is worth considering.\n",

FunTouch OS is cleaner than ever, making it a joy to use. While it's missing a telephoto camera, low-light glare can be an issue and battery life is alright. However, for the price, it's hard to beat the value the X90 Pro offers.\n",

The phone packs excellent camera configuration on the rear (48MP+50MP+2MP) and a single 16MP front camera. The storage configuration is 128GB and is non-expandable.

The displays are top-notch with no major differences between them, and the nearly creaseless design is commendable. The Open handles multitasking and heavy apps smoothly, even though the Z Fold 5 still leads in benchmark tests. The camera, especially the 3x lens, delivers impressive results, and the battery and charging performance surpasses the competition. However, OnePlus should consider adding stylus support, optimising apps for the foldable display, and making the price more reasonable. Overall, the Open marks a strong debut for OnePlus in the nascent category of foldables, and fits well into their lineup.\n",

Plus, Google's signature AI magic is baked into the software, making the experience even smarter. But here's the catch - AI isn't just Google's thing anymore. Apple's got its own take with Apple Intelligence, and Samsung and OnePlus are hot on its heels. So, Pixel's exclusivity in AI is fading fast. Performance-wise, it doesn't lead the pack. If you need raw power, the Galaxy S24 Ultra might be your go-to. For photography, the Vivo X100 Pro and Xiaomi 14 Ultra are solid alternatives, though each has trade-offs. That said, if you value a clean interface, reliable everyday use, and a killer selfie camera, the XL price tag could still feel worth it.\n",

      "Oppo Reno 5 Pro is a 5G phone that costs you under Rs 40,000. It sports a Super AMOLED screen but only with 90Hz refresh rate. It uses the latest Dimensity 1000 Plus to offer 5G support, paired with 8GB RAM for heavy usage. You get 128GB storage onboard and the phone runs on Android 11 out of box. The cameras are versatile and capable of shooting in different angles. And the built-in battery supports 65W fast charging. However, the phone lacks a memory card slot, misses out on headphone jack and has heavy competition to tackle.\n",

      "The Samsung Galaxy S23 FE sports a design similar to its older sibling, the Galaxy S23, and its extended cousin, the Galaxy A54. The stereo speakers are loud and provide a clear sound experience. The S23 FE features a 6.4-inch dynamic AMOLED display that produces sharp colours and maintains excellent indoor and outdoor brightness. The S23 FE boasts a 50MP primary camera, an 8MP telephoto camera, and a 12MP ultra-wide camera on the back. Daylight shots taken with the S23 FE are impressive and have good detail. For selfies, a 10MP front camera captures accurate images with consistent skin tones. In India, the Galaxy S23 FE is powered by the Exynos 2200 SoC rather than the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 1. The chipset handles multitasking and gaming well, though the back panel tends to get warm during extended gaming sessions. The Samsung Galaxy S23 FE has a 4500mAh battery and supports 25W fast charging, which is slow by 2023 standards. Therefore, if you're looking for a flagship-like smartphone without spending too much, the S23 FE is a solid choice.\n",

Heck, it even comes with 20W fast charger inside the box. We wish it had a faster processor and some form of water splash resistance.\n",

The device feels so sluggish that at a point you don't care about the positive bits of the device; you just feel like throwing it away for its poor performance. In spite of many class-leading features, I'd suggest you go for Xiaomi or Realme smartphones in the segment, which may not offer features as good as that of the Galaxy M31 but they get your work done and offer tremendous reliability.\n",

      "The Motorola Razr 40 Ultra offers a significant improvement compared to its predecessor. The handset features a 6.9-inch pOLED display that has up to 165Hz refresh rate. The secondary display on the device is of 3.6-inches. It's also an AMOLED panel which can display notifications, weather alerts, calendar, and quick settings. Powering the smartphone under the hood there is a Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 SoC which is fast and powerful. The device features a 12MP dual-camera setup which takes some excellent photos. The smartphone however has slow wired and wireless charging support. Additionally, the device doesn't have a microSD card either. If you are primarily looking for a clamshell-like foldable phone with a good display, design, performance, and cameras, then the Motorola Razr 40 Ultra will get all things done.\n",

The rear camera setup includes a 48MP primary camera, an 8MP ultra-wide camera, and a 2MP macro camera. On the front, there's a 13MP selfie camera. While daylight shots are good, they lack details and sharpness. In contrast, the selfie camera produces photos with accurate skin tones. The Poco X5 features a 6.67-inch AMOLED display with a 120Hz refresh rate, providing a good indoor and outdoor viewing experience. It is powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 695 SoC, offering satisfactory performance for everyday tasks. Although the phone can handle high-end gaming, the experience is not ideal due to low graphics and frame rates. Therefore, if you're in the market for a budget smartphone that performs well in day-to-day tasks, takes good photos, and has a smooth display, the Poco X5 is worth considering.\n",

The fingerprint sensor implementation is poor. The rear cameras lack night mode and any kind of video stabilization. The wide-angle shots don't come out well due to the excessive barrel distortion. All things considered, Vivo's V15 Pro is a more balanced choice. It comes with a more stylish design, a full-screen OLED screen, and much better cameras.

It sports a Quad HD+ AMOLED 120Hz display, powered by latest Snapdragon 888 Plus chipset, with 12GB RAM and 256GB storage. The rear cameras are pretty good and offer versatility and results. It supports fast charging as well. However, the phone misses out on headphone jack, memory card slot and all this power takes a toll on battery life. Worth buying if you need a premium phone.\n",

      "The Redmi K20 is one of the best trimmed down versions of a flagship smartphone ever released. Except the Snapdragon 855 chipset and 4K 60fps video recording, it retains all the features of the Redmi K20 Pro. It looks similarly attractive, has the same great AMOLED screen, loud speakers, headphone jack, and long battery life. Its cameras are great for the price. The performance, while not as fast as the Snapdragon 855 on the Redmi K20 Pro, comes eerily close and you won't feel much of a difference even while gaming unless you're comparing side-by-side. If only it had a faster fingerprint reader and better auto brightness, it would've been the most perfect phone in its segment.\n",

The screen size remains identical, with support for Full HD+ resolution but at this price, you expect high refresh rate as well.

Then you have storage up to 1TB if required and the cameras give you decent photos as well. The battery backup won't let you down either.

If the display panel and battery life aren't a concern for you, then you should get the Y73. The other option in this price range you could consider buying is the iQOO Z3.\n",

You get AMOLED screen but lacks high refresh rate support. It get 6GB RAM by default with 128GB storage which can be expanded further. Android 11-based ColorOS fares well and the battery life should satisfy most users, especially with its 33W fast charging support. Loses out to better options in the market for us.\n",

The CPU and graphical performance are also not up to the mark, especially when compared to more affordable offerings loaded with Snapdragon 660 chipsets. The nail in the coffin is the absence of fast charge. Unless you absolutely need the rear wide angle lens, you might be better off with one of the various other offerings at this price point.\n",

The phone also offers a reliable 5G chipset that handles most of the daily tasks and provides 5G connectivity. However, the company is still providing 25W fast charging support at a time when the competition is offering 60W+ fast charging in this similar price segment.\n",

The quad-camera setup at the rear, especially, is a show stopper. It features a 64MP primary camera, something that even the flagships like OnePlus 8 don't offer, a proper telephoto camera, which I think is the first in the segment, and an 8MP ultrawide sensor. The front camera setup is no slouch; you get a 16MP main sensor and an 8MP ultrawide unit. Then comes the silky-smooth 90Hz display, a first in the segment. And to drive the screen, the powerful Snapdragon 720G SoC. To top things off you get the fastest charging in the segment  -  30 watts  -  to quickly recharge the large 4300mAh battery pack.\n",

Its 48MP camera clicks excellent stills even in low-light conditions, at least for the price. Its performance is fast enough for gaming and day-to-day tasks, and its battery life is more than a day.

It has a sober design, an AMOLED screen with an in-display fingerprint reader, a fast processor, a cleaner and better version of ColorOS, a long-lasting battery life, 20W fast charging, and a USB Type-C port.  It is essentially a rebranded Realme X with a 16MP+2MP rear camera setup rather than a 48MP+5MP camera. The only areas where it falls slightly short is its cameras and its software UI. The OPPO K3 comes with just two rear-facing sensors. OPPO also needs to improve ColorOS to add more customizability and cohesiveness. If you don't care too much about ultrawide-angle cameras, you should definitely consider the OPPO K3.\n",

Furthermore, the performance hit isn't too bad thanks to how well optimized the software is. Unfortunately, the INR 39,999 price tag for the Pixel 3a is just too much when options like the OnePlus7, Vivo Nex, Galaxy A80, and Zenfone 6 exist at around the same price point. Somewhere around the INR 30,000 mark is where this phone should have been positioned.\n",

The hardware in tow is just about average with its performance and the cameras are also there to make the numbers. The battery life also is low because of its size. Not the phone we'd recommend to anyone in the market these days.\n",

However, the Realme 11 Pro+ offers significant upgrades at a similar price point. Still, in the sub-'     25K range, it is the most visually appealing and reliable phone overall.\n",

Which is why you get 2GB RAM but the built-in Unisoc chipset fares below expectations, even at this price. Having said that, you do get a large screen with HD+ resolution that can be used for watching videos. Having multiple rear cameras is always a bonus at the price, and you get a decent selfie camera too. However, the battery life could have been better.\n",

      "Micromax 1N 128GB is yet another affordable brand from the Indian brand. The phone packs impressive specifications at the price range. The device sports a 6.67-inches IPS LCD with a resolution of 1080 x 2400 pixels. The phone comes powered by a MediaTek Helio G80 processor paired with 6GB RAM and 128GB internal storage (further expandable up to 256GB using a microSD card). It packs impressive triple rear cameras consisting of a 48MP macro camera, a 2MP macro camera, and a 2MP depth camera. Upfront, there is an 8MP selfie camera that also aids in video calling. The phone relies on a 5000mAh battery with 18W fast-charging for power backup. As for the cons, the device is bulky (195 grams) and difficult to operate with a single hand. Also, it runs Android v10 (Q) operating system rather than the latest Android v(11) operating system.\n",

      "Lava Z2s runs on Android Go version which makes it a hard-core budget device with 2GB RAM on board. It comes powered by octa-core chipset but everything else about this phone is strictly average. You get single cameras on both sides. The display does come with Corning Gorilla Glass 3 protection which is rare at this price. And even the 5,000mAh battery should last you for a while. Worth skipping if you need a budget phone because better options out there.\n",

The single rear camera is good for the price, and so is the battery life. However, the phone's performance is average, only has microUSB port for charging and the front camera is basic. Better to buy other budget options.\n",

      "Samsung's new Galaxy A03 64GB phone underwhelms for its price tag. It sports an HD+ display with a notch. The hardware is basic but you do get 4GB RAM with this variant. The storage is expandable, the main camera does well, but the others are strictly average. The battery life is good but charging support is slow.\n",

Moreover, the phone comes with a large display that makes it good for everyday usage. However, the phone runs on a dated Android version and comes with an unknown chipset, which makes it difficult to determine how well will it perform.\n",

However, its UI is cluttered, and the price may feel high given its competition. Alternatives like the Vivo T3 Ultra, Realme GT 6T, Poco F6, or Motorola Edge 50 Pro could offer better value  depending on your needs.\n",

The display is vibrant, with immersive audio and good brightness even in sunlight. The camera captures sharp daylight shots, and the telephoto lens is a nice touch.

Just watch out for noise in low light and occasional inconsistencies in skin tone during portrait mode. Powered by the Snapdragon 7s Gen 3 SoC, it cruises through daily tasks and gaming with ease. Plus, its 5100mAh battery keeps you going strong. And hey, it still rocks a headphone jack and IR transmitter, which is a nice bonus. However, its reliance on Android 13 may deter some users, especially given the year is 2024.
