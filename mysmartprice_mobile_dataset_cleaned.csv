While the design sees minor refinements, it looks more sophisticated, and the 6,000mAh battery sets a new benchmark. The Snapdragon 8 Elite delivers impressive performance, excelling in high-intensity gaming with better heat management than rivals like iQOO 13 and Realme GT 7 Pro. However, its camera setup isn't a significant upgrade and faces tough competition from the Vivo X200 and Find X8. Despite a higher price, the OnePlus 13 is a well-rounded flagship, ideal for those seeking performance and reliability."

For those who appreciate a stylish phone, Motorola has ensured that this device caters to their needs. With a curved screen offering vibrant, punchy colours, it's a standout option in the sub-Rs 20,000 range. On the camera front, it captures social media-ready photos, though they may appear artificial. While the phone can handle demanding tasks without issue, it does tend to heat up after extended use. If you're after a phone with a clean and straightforward software experience, this one checks all the right boxes."

Absolutely. Powered by the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3, the 13R delivers excellent performance with clean software and minimal bloatware. Design-wise, the OnePlus 12R had a more premium look, but the 13R's design is still solid - personal preference plays a big part here. The display is vibrant, with immersive audio and good brightness even in sunlight. The camera captures sharp daylight shots, and the telephoto lens is a nice touch. Low-light photos may not always impress, but it's not a deal-breaker. Despite the price hike, the OnePlus 13R continues to impress, carrying forward the legacy of its predecessors with subtle, smart improvements."

It's battery life and fast charging is standout features.  On the downside, the camera's colour accuracy could be better, and there's some bloatware in the software. For a better camera, consider the Vivo V30e, or if you want a cleaner software experience, the Motorola Edge 50 Fusion is a good alternative."

Despite a slightly less powerful custom chip, it adeptly handles all tasks. Noteworthy display improvements, including an anti-reflective coating, stand out, though the phone's weight remains a drawback despite a titanium build. Software enhancements and reliable battery life make it a solid choice, though charging speeds maintain a consistent performance. Despite ongoing jokes about its cost, the Galaxy S24 Ultra stands as the top Android phone."

But as with its predecessors, it carries a similar premium of Rs 30,999 for the base model of 128GB built-in storage to deliver the same.    In the past few years, this upper mid-tier segment has drawn a lot of competition. So, if you want pure specs, you can find better options such as the Motorola Edge 50 Pro and Realme 12 Pro Plus. Both handsets ship with Qualcomm's powerful 7 series processors and quad cameras at the back. If you're looking for beauty with brains, then the Vivo V30 is also a good option, especially considering it's the first V series handset with Zeiss certification for imaging."

The design leans a bit too much toward the iPhone look, with subtle changes that could have been more refined. The display is excellent, boosted by the 144Hz refresh rate, while the camera is decent, though improvements are needed in telephoto, low-light, and portrait shots. Overall, this phone isn't a huge leap from the iQOO 12, but software updates could improve things. If you're after better camera performance and slightly more power, the Realme GT 7 Pro is worth considering."

Gaming is smooth, and the robust battery with 100W fast charging ensures you stay powered up. While its cameras excel in daylight, low-light performance could be better. Opting out of bloatware is a plus, but longer software support would be appreciated. Overall, it's a solid choice under Rs 25,000 for those seeking dependable performance."

We won't say it has zero bloat, but it's cleaner than several other smartphones in its price category. It's competing against the Realme GT 6T, and the two phones offer very similar feature sets. But we believe your choice will ultimately rely on the aesthetics, specifically a flat display vs curved and a metal unibody vs glass sandwich."

While BGMI and Call of Duty: Mobile need better optimization, it offers a fantastic display and long-lasting battery for entertainment and daily use. However, its cameras struggle with exposure, and the OS can be intrusive with notifications. If you prefer strong optics, the Vivo T3 Pro is a solid alternative, while the Nothing Phone 2 offers a cleaner UI. For pure performance, the X7 Pro excels."

Its curved AMOLED display and 144Hz refresh rate enhance content and gaming experiences. The triple camera setup, including a 3x telephoto lens, performs well. Competing with models like Realme 12 Pro Plus and OnePlus Nord 3, it shines in overall usability but may fall behind in raw performance."

The 200MP sensor delivers impressive detail and low-light performance. The display is more responsive and easier to use, making the overall user experience smoother. The phone feels great in hand, and its performance is top-tier. The battery life is excellent for a compact phone.    However, the ultrawide camera struggles in low-light video, and the processor can throttle under heavy loads, which may impact performance in demanding tasks, like gaming. Despite these minor drawbacks, the X200 Pro remains a compelling choice for those seeking a powerful and versatile smartphone."

With its vibrant design and a camera setup boasting a hefty 200MP main lens and an 8MP ultra-wide snapper, along with a 16MP selfie shooter - the Note 13 Pro caters to photography buffs. Just watch out for noise in low light and occasional inconsistencies in skin tone during portrait mode. Powered by the Snapdragon 7s Gen 3 SoC, it cruises through daily tasks and gaming with ease. Plus, its 5100mAh battery keeps you going strong. And hey, it still rocks a headphone jack and IR transmitter, which is a nice bonus. However, its reliance on Android 13 may deter some users, especially given the year is 2024. Nonetheless, if you're seeking a phone that delivers in terms of cameras, performance, and display quality, the Note 13 Pro is the one for you."

The screen supports up to 1000 nits of peak brightness, so the panel is adequately bright, but outdoor visibility can be a bit challenging under direct sunlight. The colours on the display aren't particularly vibrant or punchy but lean more towards a neutral approach. For photography, the Vivo T3x is equipped with a 50MP primary camera and a 2MP depth sensor on the back. The photos taken with this smartphone are good but sometimes images lack adequate details. The dynamic range is limited, which may be a drawback for some users. Regardless, for the price, the photos are impressive.   Low-light performance is average.

But, if there's an older model you want to change, this is a good option provided you are looking for a reliable mid-range phone.

A competition to encourage third-party accessory innovation could boost its appeal.

On the plus side, the vegan leather finish adds a touch of elegance, making it visually appealing. The display offers good colour reproduction but outdoor brightness levels could have been better. When it comes to battery life, the G45 underperforms and doesn't provide the reliability you'd expect. However, if your priority is a phone that delivers solid performance, handles daily tasks with ease, offers decent camera quality for its price, and you're willing to overlook some design shortcomings, the G45 could be the right pick for you."

Its attractive design and solid build add to its appeal. However, the ultra-wide camera needs improvement, and the UI is cluttered with annoying notifications and bloatware. Overall, it's a strong choice for an upper-mid-range phone that feels premium, but if you prefer cleaner software, consider the Motorola Edge 50 Pro instead."

The display is vibrant and smooth, great for gaming, with solid audio. However, bloatware and inconsistent camera performance are drawbacks. While the performance is good, it's not the best in its class - consider the CMF Phone 1 or iQOO Z9x for more power. Despite some minor issues, this is a solid upgrade from last year and could be the right choice if you can overlook the bloatware."

However, compared to the Reno12 Pro, it doesn't bring a major upgrade. The butterfly-illusion effect is eye-catching, but the rest of the design feels familiar. The display is sharp, with HDR 10 improving multimedia, while the audio adds to the experience. For performance, it's not the best. It handles daily tasks well but struggles with gaming and benchmarking. Alternatives like the iQOO 12 or OnePlus 13R may be better for gamers. The camera is good, but a few minor issues can be fixed via an update. ColorOS 15 is visually engaging but suffers from bloatware, making the interface feel cluttered. Overall, the Reno13 Pro brings meaningful improvements, but it still needs refinement to match a truly premium experience."

With a reliable 5,000mAh battery, 90W charging, and HyperOS, it's a solid all-rounder despite some bloatware. At Rs 29,999, it competes with the Realme GT 6T but stands out as one of the top choices for performance-focused users."

It's powered by the Exynos 2400 SoC, which excels at multitasking. The phone handles any task with ease and performs well in gaming. The 120Hz refresh rate enhances the display, making it buttery smooth. After extended gaming sessions, it doesn't heat up excessively. However, the phone has a 4000mAh battery, which is quite small compared to other budget and mid-range smartphones. Despite this, the battery life is good, lasting almost 24 hours with light usage. The phone supports 25W charging, which is relatively low, and unfortunately, it doesn't include a charger in the box. Regarding the camera, the phone boasts a 50MP primary camera, a 10MP telephoto camera, and a 12MP ultra-wide camera on the rear. The primary and telephoto cameras perform well, but the ultra-wide camera still lacks autofocus. Low-light photography is decent but can sometimes be grainy. On the front, there's a 12MP selfie camera that works effectively. Overall, the Samsung Galaxy S24 is a compact phone with strong performance, impressive cameras, and good battery life."

The front camera performs adequately, but the rear camera doesn't quite impress. So, if you're looking for a lightweight phone that excels in gaming, charges rapidly, and offers solid battery life, the Realme Narzo 70 Turbo is worth considering.

It performs well for casual gaming and everyday tasks, with a snappy, bloat-free software experience. Camera performance shines in good lighting, but low-light and selfies need some improvement.

The phone also sports an excellent SAMOLED display with a 120Hz refresh rate, making it ideal for content consumption. It also works well in bright sunlight. But the audio quality does leave one wanting, especially when watching TV shows. The battery life and performance are also adequate for most users. However, the phone is not ideal for heavy-duty gaming and struggles with titles like Call of Duty: Mobile.

What stands out is the design, the general performance, the camera, and the large battery size. The user interface is also simple.     But then Motorola is restricting Android updates to just one more version. Is this the best display one can get on a phone? No, nor is it a device centred around gaming. But then, given the price, it ticks some of the more important boxes quite nicely. If one goes by pricing, its biggest rival would be the Realme P1, which has more to offer on the gaming front.

The design is similar to its predecessor, though the new Mecha RGB loop lighting is a nice touch. Battery life could be better.

Its design closely mirrors that of the premium Galaxy phones, though the inclusion of a 6000mAh battery makes it noticeably chunky. The 6.5-inch FHD+ display offers a 90Hz refresh rate, staying bright even under sunlight. As for the cameras, it has a 50MP main shooter, a 5MP ultra-wide angle camera, and a 2MP macro shooter at the rear. It has a 13MP camera at the front for selfies. For its price, the phone captures adequately satisfying pictures. Powering the Galaxy F15 5G is the MediaTek Dimensity 6100+ chipset, which suits everyday users well. It handles tasks such as texting, social media browsing, and light gaming with 5G connectivity capably. Samsung pledges four years of Android updates and five years of security patches for the Galaxy F15. It runs on OneUI 6 based on Android 14, but misses out on a bunch of features such as Always On Display and screen recording.

Its 6.67-inch AMOLED display offers a smooth 120Hz refresh rate, making it perfect for multimedia consumption. On the rear, you'll find a 108MP primary camera paired with a 2MP macro camera, delivering high-quality images rich in detail. Meanwhile, the 16MP selfie camera on the front captures impressive shots in daylight, although its performance in low light is average. The phone is powered by the MediaTek Dimensity 6080 SoC, ensuring smooth daily performance and decent gaming capabilities, albeit with occasional minor lags. Running on MIUI 14, the Poco X6 Neo suffers from abundant bloatware. Equipped with a 5000mAh battery and a 33W fast charging adapter, the phone can comfortably last a day for moderate to heavy users. In summary, if you're in the market for a smartphone with strong performance, a capable camera for detailed shots, and a slim design, the Poco X6 Neo is definitely worth considering."

Its 6.7-inch AMOLED display with a speedy 120Hz refresh rate makes switching apps a breeze, while HDR 10+ support brings colours to life. Despite its rather ordinary design, the matte finish keeps fingerprints at bay. On the back, you'll find a 64MP main camera, an 8MP ultra-wide camera, and a 2MP macro shooter, with a 32MP selfie camera up front. Picture quality is alright, but watch out for the selfie cam - it might make your face a bit too smooth. At the helm of it is the MediaTek Dimensity 7050 SoC, the F25 Pro handles everyday tasks and light gaming effortlessly. However, be prepared for lacklustre performance especially on high-end games, as the processor is based on a three-year-old architecture. With ColorOS 14 on board, based on Android 14, there's plenty of room for customisation, the presence of pre-installed apps can clutter the experience.

The Vivo X200, also with the Dimensity 9400, is another competitor with a similar design and great camera capabilities.

It handles daily tasks effortlessly, with battery life lasting well into the next day. The clean software and game-changing AI features, like Pixel Screenshots and automatic photo edits, are highlights. While its performance lags behind the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra and others, it outshines the pricier Pixel 9 Pro XL. It can heat up during gaming or camera use, but cools down fast. Overall, it's a reliable, user-friendly device with long software support - though you'll pay a premium for it."

The AI features on this phone are far from just gimmicks, and they can actually come in handy for office-goers and students. The cameras are good too, but the ultra-wide shooter and the low-light photography need a bit of tweaking; however, these are just minor gripes that don't really affect the phone's quality in the grand scheme of things."

In terms of camera, users get a 50MP primary rear camera coupled with a macro lens. The picture quality is decent in the day, but if a higher-resolution camera is your priority, you may want to look elsewhere.    The MediaTek Dimensity 6100+ under its hood offers modest performance, and a mid-tier processor on a smartphone is surprising given the SoC can be seen on devices like Xiaomi Redmi 13C 5G, Poco M6 5G, Realme 11x 5G, and more that cost between Rs 10,000-Rs 15,000.

On the rear, the phone is equipped with a 50MP AI camera alongside a 2MP depth camera, while a 5MP selfie camera graces the front. Picture quality is decent, however, if the camera is your main priority, you may have to look elsewhere. As for performance, the phone is fueled by the MediaTek Dimensity 6100+ SoC, which is adequate given its price point. While users might encounter occasional stutters and lags, these shouldn't significantly impede daily tasks. The device ships with a plethora of pre-installed apps, which can somewhat mar the software experience. Powering the device is a 5000mAh battery with support for up to 18W of charging. However, the inclusion of a 10W charging adapter in the box means full charging might take over two hours.

The phone is powered by the MediaTek Dimensity 6100+ SoC, providing smooth performance for everyday tasks. Casual games like Subway Surfers and Clash of Clans run well, but you may notice stuttering and lag with high-end games. The rear camera setup includes a 50MP primary camera, a 5MP secondary camera, and a 2MP camera. The front camera is a 13MP selfie shooter. While the image quality is good, it's not extraordinary, and low-light photography can be quite noisy. The phone has a 6000mAh battery and supports 25W charging, which is relatively slow for such a large battery.

The primary display works well, but the secondary cover display struggles with widget integration. It's functional but not the best. In the sub-Rs 25,000 range, the Agni 3 stands out but has room for improvement. A software update could resolve many issues. Priced at Rs 20,999 (without the charger), it's a solid buy.

However, it may struggle in low-light conditions. For those seeking a device for everyday tasks like watching videos and using social media, the AMOLED 3D curved display offers a satisfying solution. While the phone's design is undeniably stunning, slapping a case to the back is advisable to prevent accidental slips from your hands. Performance-wise, the Vivo V29 utilises the Qualcomm Snapdragon 778G SoC, which some may consider outdated.

With a hefty 4800mAh battery and 44W fast charging support, you're set for a day of uninterrupted use. Now, let's talk about the camera setup. On the rear, there's a 64MP primary camera with OIS and a 2MP bokeh camera, accompanied by a smooth aura ring light for improved low-light photography. For selfies, there's a 16MP front camera that captures decent shots, although it sometimes smoothens the skin, giving it an unnatural look. Running on FuntouchOS 13 based on Android 13, the Vivo Y200 5G offers ample customisation options, albeit accompanied by some pre-installed apps you might not need.

The phone is very smooth for everyday use, and the animations are excellent, which is impressive.

It boasts a 50MP primary camera, a 50MP telephoto camera, and a 50MP ultra-wide camera. On the front, there's a 32MP selfie camera. The Xiaomi 14 can take incredible pictures in all environments, and the low-light picture quality is also great. The device has a 4610mAh battery, which is not particularly impressive, but it supports a 90W hypercharger, fully charging the phone in 35 minutes, which is quite convenient.

Battery-wise, you've got a hefty 5000mAh unit that'll keep you going all day long. However, the inclusion of only a 10W charging adapter in the box means you'll be waiting a while for it to juice up fully. The only downside?

While the Pro model boasts a vegan leather finish, the 12x comes with a plastic build. The Realme 12x features a 6.72-inch LCD display with a 120Hz refresh rate, offering a decent viewing experience for its price range. However, don't expect the vibrant colours of an AMOLED display. At the rear, the phone comes with a 50MP primary camera and a 2MP depth sensor, but it lacks an ultra-wide camera. Photos taken with the Realme 12x are sharp, though the colours tend to be on the warmer side. The 8MP front camera captures selfies with artificial skin tones but is still social-media ready. Low-light photography results in grainy and noisy images. Powered by the MediaTek Dimensity 6100+ SoC, the Realme 12x handles everyday tasks like calling, texting, social media, and casual browsing well. For heavy gaming, it can run titles like BGMI on HD graphics, but you might experience some stutters and lags. The device runs on Android 14 out-of-the-box, offering plenty of animations and customisation options. The Realme 12x includes a 5000mAh battery and comes with a 45W SUPERVOOC charger. It takes about 55 minutes to an hour to fully charge, and the battery can last a full day with light to moderate use. Considering its design, functionality, and impressive battery life, the Realme 12x is a solid choice for those seeking an affordable and stylish smartphone for everyday use."

For selfies, there's a 32MP front camera, delivering accurate skin tones. The Samsung Galaxy F54 is powered by the Exynos 1380 chipset, which effortlessly handles daily tasks such as multitasking, calling, and messaging, among others. The phone is also capable of running heavy games like BGMI and Call of Duty: Mobile, although it may tend to heat up after extended use. Running on One UI 5.1 based on Android 13, the device offers plenty of customisation options, although it does come with some bloatware, fortunately removable. With a robust 6000mAh battery and 25W fast charging support, the Galaxy F54 ensures long-lasting battery life, although it's worth noting that the charger is not included in the box.

The performance truly stands out. In terms of design, the Narzo 70 features a boxy shape with a glossy back finish, while the front sports a flat display. The bezels are relatively slim for this price range, which is a notable advantage. Although the design isn't innovative, the display quality is impressive for a phone in this segment. The phone has a substantial feel and is not particularly lightweight. It features a 50-megapixel AI camera alongside a 2-megapixel mono camera on the back, delivering decent photo quality.

Not to forget, the OxygenOS is here to stay and is a popular Android skin.      Some of the biggest strengths of the device are its performance, display, battery, and primary camera are among the best out there. Unfortunately, we can't say that for all sensors. The ultra-wide camera, in particular, doesn't impress. But, then, the missing IP rating is slightly a heartbreak. It's a feature that is always good to have. Not to forget, OnePlus will also need to tighten its update cycle for both OS and security updates. We also think that it's about time that OnePlus starts shipping a 512GB storage variant with its flagship phones."

This device has a 50MP primary camera, a 2MP bokeh camera, and a flicker sensor. It delivers adequate picture quality during the day, albeit with a tendency to over-brighten faces. However, its edge detection capabilities leave room for improvement. The performance from the Qualcomm Snapdragon 4 Gen 2 SoC isn't the best in class, so, If performance and gaming rank high on your priority list, you might want to explore other options.

However, it falls short in the 5G compatibility department. Display-wise, its 6.56-inch IPS LCD screen offers a 90Hz refresh rate, though its performance under bright sunlight is somewhat lacklustre for its price range. On the camera front, users are equipped with a 50MP main camera, a 2MP macro snapper, along with a 16MP selfie shooter. While the camera setup delivers decent results, it may not satisfy users seeking crisp details, and the selfie camera tends to overly smooth the skin, yielding an artificial appearance. Powered by the MediaTek Helio G85 chipset, the Moto G24 Power suits regular usage but may struggle with high-end gaming demands. Thankfully, its Android 14-based My UX interface provides a nearly stock Android experience with minimal pre-installed apps, coupled with extensive customization options. The smartphone is powered by a 6000mAh battery that should last for an entire day. So, if you're okay with skipping the 5G hype and can live with some average camera action, the Moto G24 Power could be your budget-friendly companion."

The display is highly responsive and buttery smooth. However, this phone lacks stereo speakers, which can be a dealbreaker for many. The phone features a MediaTek Dimensity 7200 SoC, which performs well in day-to-day usage. Gaming on this phone is also good, but you may notice occasional lags and stutters when playing intensive games. The phone packs a 4600mAh battery and comes with a 66W charging adapter. The charging speeds are decent. The Vivo V27 runs on FunTouchOS 13, based on Android 13, which comes with bloatware. The V27 offers good customisation options for the home screen and lock screen. At the rear, there's a 50MP main camera with OIS, an 8MP ultra-wide camera, and a 2MP super macro camera. On the front, there's a 50MP camera with autofocus for selfies. The main camera on this phone is brilliant; however, the ultra-wide and super macro cameras need some improvement. The front camera clicks selfies that can be posted on social media without any editing.

Expect true-to-life images without over-processing. Performance-wise, the phone houses the MediaTek Dimensity 8200 SoC, handling everyday tasks with ease, from gaming to multitasking, all without any hiccups. And with a rather decent 4600mAh battery, you'll go all day without a hitch. Oh, and say goodbye to bloatware - FunTouch 13 based on Android 13 lets you declutter your phone.

The stereo speakers on the S21 FE produce excellent sound quality, which is a bonus. In terms of battery life, the phone houses a 4500mAh battery, lasting almost a day with light to moderate usage. Regarding the cameras, there's a 12MP main camera with OIS, an 8MP telephoto camera, and a 12MP ultra-wide camera on the rear. For selfies, there's a 32MP front-facing camera. Daylight shots are vibrant and detailed, but the ultra-wide camera lacks autofocus. The selfie camera captures natural photos with consistent skin tones. Low-light photography on this device brightens images, sometimes excessively. Overall, the Galaxy S21 FE ticks most boxes with a few drawbacks.

It is essentially a rebranded Realme X with a 16MP+2MP rear camera setup rather than a 48MP+5MP camera. The only areas where it falls slightly short is its cameras and its software UI. The OPPO K3 comes with just two rear-facing sensors. OPPO also needs to improve ColorOS to add more customizability and cohesiveness. If you don't care too much about ultrawide-angle cameras, you should definitely consider the OPPO K3."

The phone packs impressive specifications at the price range. The device sports a 6.67-inches IPS LCD with a resolution of 1080 x 2400 pixels. The phone comes powered by a MediaTek Helio G80 processor paired with 6GB RAM and 128GB internal storage (further expandable up to 256GB using a microSD card). It packs impressive triple rear cameras consisting of a 48MP macro camera, a 2MP macro camera, and a 2MP depth camera. Upfront, there is an 8MP selfie camera that also aids in video calling.

Also, it runs Android v10 (Q) operating system rather than the latest Android v(11) operating system."

The display does come with Corning Gorilla Glass 3 protection which is rare at this price. And even the 5,000mAh battery should last you for a while. Worth skipping if you need a budget phone because better options out there."

It packs an octa-core processor with 2GB RAM, offers expandable storage, and sports a large 6-inch HD+ screen. The single rear camera is good for the price, and so is the battery life. However, the phone's performance is average, only has microUSB port for charging and the front camera is basic. Better to buy other budget options."
