While the design sees minor refinements, it looks more sophisticated, and the 6,000mAh battery sets a new benchmark. The Snapdragon 8 Elite delivers impressive performance, excelling in high-intensity gaming with better heat management than rivals like iQOO 13 and Realme GT 7 Pro. However, its camera setup isn't a significant upgrade and faces tough competition from the Vivo X200 and Find X8.

However, it's heavy enough to double as a weight. The low light photography is somewhere you will have to compromise. Additionally, for superior gaming, you might want to explore other options."

On the camera front, it captures social media-ready photos, though they may appear artificial. While the phone can handle demanding tasks without issue, it does tend to heat up after extended use. If you're after a phone with a clean and straightforward software experience, this one checks all the right boxes."

Absolutely. Powered by the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3, the 13R delivers excellent performance with clean software and minimal bloatware. Design-wise, the OnePlus 12R had a more premium look, but the 13R's design is still solid - personal preference plays a big part here. The display is vibrant, with immersive audio and good brightness even in sunlight. The camera captures sharp daylight shots, and the telephoto lens is a nice touch. Low-light photos may not always impress, but it's not a deal-breaker. Despite the price hike, the OnePlus 13R continues to impress, carrying forward the legacy of its predecessors with subtle, smart improvements."
8,vivo T3 Pro,"Release:  3 Sep, 2024","₹22,999",4.5,24.7K Ratings,Snapdragon 7 Gen 3 Octa core,50+8 MP Rear Camera,16 MP Front Camera,6.77″ (17.2 cm) 120Hz AMOLED Display,8 GB RAM | 128 GB Storage,5500 mAh | 80W Fast Charging,Android v14 OS,5G | Fingerprint Sensor,"The Vivo T3 Pro, starting at Rs 24,999, offers a stylish design, a crisp AMOLED display, and solid performance for everyday use and moderate gaming. It's battery life and fast charging is standout features.  On the downside, the camera's colour accuracy could be better, and there's some bloatware in the software.

However, its drawbacks, including bloatware, spammy notifications, and a steep price, cannot be overlooked. Alternatives like the Vivo T3 Ultra offer better performance, the Realme GT 6T provides balanced features, and the Motorola Edge 50 Pro delivers a clean UI experience."

Despite a slightly less powerful custom chip, it adeptly handles all tasks. Noteworthy display improvements, including an anti-reflective coating, stand out, though the phone's weight remains a drawback despite a titanium build. Software enhancements and reliable battery life make it a solid choice, though charging speeds maintain a consistent performance. Despite ongoing jokes about its cost, the Galaxy S24 Ultra stands as the top Android phone."
11,Samsung Galaxy A35 5G,"Release:  14 Mar, 2024","₹22,449",4.3,"4,087 Ratings",Samsung Exynos 1380 Octa core,50+8+5 MP Rear Camera,13 MP Front Camera,6.6″ (16.76 cm) 120Hz Super AMOLED Display,8 GB RAM | 128 GB Storage,5000 mAh | 25W Fast Charging,Android v14 OS,5G | NFC | Fingerprint Sensor,"The Samsung Galaxy A35 is an elegant smartphone with features that would meet the needs of modern, everyday consumers. But as with its predecessors, it carries a similar premium of Rs 30,999 for the base model of 128GB built-in storage to deliver the same.    In the past few years, this upper mid-tier segment has drawn a lot of competition. So, if you want pure specs, you can find better options such as the Motorola Edge 50 Pro and Realme 12 Pro Plus. Both handsets ship with Qualcomm's powerful 7 series processors and quad cameras at the back. If you're looking for beauty with brains, then the Vivo V30 is also a good option, especially considering it's the first V series handset with Zeiss certification for imaging."
12,iQOO 13 5G,"Release:  3 Dec, 2024","₹54,999",5.0,5 Ratings,Snapdragon 8 Elite Octa core,50+50+50 MP Rear Camera,32 MP Front Camera,6.82″ (17.32 cm) 144Hz LTPO AMOLED Display,12 GB RAM | 256 GB Storage,6000 mAh | 120W Fast Charging,Android v15 OS,5G | NFC | Fingerprint Sensor,"The iQOO 13 handles heavy gaming, but we did experience some hiccups. The design leans a bit too much toward the iPhone look, with subtle changes that could have been more refined. The display is excellent, boosted by the 144Hz refresh rate, while the camera is decent, though improvements are needed in telephoto, low-light, and portrait shots. Overall, this phone isn't a huge leap from the iQOO 12, but software updates could improve things. If you're after better camera performance and slightly more power, the Realme GT 7 Pro is worth considering."

Gaming is smooth, and the robust battery with 100W fast charging ensures you stay powered up. While its cameras excel in daylight, low-light performance could be better. Opting out of bloatware is a plus, but longer software support would be appreciated. Overall, it's a solid choice under Rs 25,000 for those seeking dependable performance."
14,OnePlus Nord 4,"Release:  20 Jul, 2024","₹27,989",4.4,"1,031 Ratings",Snapdragon 7 Plus Gen 3 Octa core,50+8 MP Rear Camera,16 MP Front Camera,6.74″ (17.12 cm) 120Hz AMOLED Display,8 GB RAM | 128 GB Storage,5500 mAh | 100W Fast Charging,Android v14 OS,5G | NFC | Fingerprint Sensor,"The Nord 4's new design, processor, bigger battery and AI capabilities make it a worthy successor to the previous cult hit Nords. We won't say it has zero bloat, but it's cleaner than several other smartphones in its price category. It's competing against the Realme GT 6T, and the two phones offer very similar feature sets. But we believe your choice will ultimately rely on the aesthetics, specifically a flat display vs curved and a metal unibody vs glass sandwich."

While BGMI and Call of Duty: Mobile need better optimization, it offers a fantastic display and long-lasting battery for entertainment and daily use. However, its cameras struggle with exposure, and the OS can be intrusive with notifications. If you prefer strong optics, the Vivo T3 Pro is a solid alternative, while the Nothing Phone 2 offers a cleaner UI. For pure performance, the X7 Pro excels."

Its curved AMOLED display and 144Hz refresh rate enhance content and gaming experiences. The triple camera setup, including a 3x telephoto lens, performs well. Competing with models like Realme 12 Pro Plus and OnePlus Nord 3, it shines in overall usability but may fall behind in raw performance."

The 200MP sensor delivers impressive detail and low-light performance. The display is more responsive and easier to use, making the overall user experience smoother. The phone feels great in hand, and its performance is top-tier. The battery life is excellent for a compact phone.    However, the ultrawide camera struggles in low-light video, and the processor can throttle under heavy loads, which may impact performance in demanding tasks, like gaming. Despite these minor drawbacks, the X200 Pro remains a compelling choice for those seeking a powerful and versatile smartphone."

Its balanced performance is bolstered by impressive software features. However, if gaming is your priority, consider the OnePlus Nord 4 or the Poco F6 in this price range. But if good looks are all that matter - good looks and more good looks - this phone is an ideal choice."

It handles daily tasks well. But there are flaws, like an underwhelming ultra-wide camera and spammy notifications which may dampen your excitement. If you prioritise photography, consider the iQOO Z9s, and for a clean UI, the Motorola Edge 50 Fusion is a better choice."

It sports a sleek design, an AMOLED display with a sharp 1.5K resolution, and a reliable battery backup. With its vibrant design and a camera setup boasting a hefty 200MP main lens and an 8MP ultra-wide snapper, along with a 16MP selfie shooter - the Note 13 Pro caters to photography buffs. Just watch out for noise in low light and occasional inconsistencies in skin tone during portrait mode. Powered by the Snapdragon 7s Gen 3 SoC, it cruises through daily tasks and gaming with ease. Plus, its 5100mAh battery keeps you going strong. And hey, it still rocks a headphone jack and IR transmitter, which is a nice bonus. However, its reliance on Android 13 may deter some users, especially given the year is 2024. Nonetheless, if you're seeking a phone that delivers in terms of cameras, performance, and display quality, the Note 13 Pro is the one for you."

It handles everything except heavy gaming - if that's your focus, check out the iQOO Z9s or Realme 13 Plus. For top-tier gaming, the POCO F6 is a beast. But if you're into stylish phones and love great cameras, the Edge 50 Neo is perfect."

The screen supports up to 1000 nits of peak brightness, so the panel is adequately bright, but outdoor visibility can be a bit challenging under direct sunlight. The colours on the display aren't particularly vibrant or punchy but lean more towards a neutral approach. For photography, the Vivo T3x is equipped with a 50MP primary camera and a 2MP depth sensor on the back. The photos taken with this smartphone are good but sometimes images lack adequate details. The dynamic range is limited, which may be a drawback for some users. Regardless, for the price, the photos are impressive.   Low-light performance is average.

The phone mostly impresses but isn't a major upgrade over the Galaxy A54. So, if you are still using that phone, no need to upgrade.    But, if there's an older model you want to change, this is a good option provided you are looking for a reliable mid-range phone.      As for the alternatives, you can go for the OnePlus 12R, which comes with a Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 chipset and is a performance-centric device.

On the plus side, the vegan leather finish adds a touch of elegance, making it visually appealing. The display offers good colour reproduction but outdoor brightness levels could have been better. When it comes to battery life, the G45 underperforms and doesn't provide the reliability you'd expect. However, if your priority is a phone that delivers solid performance, handles daily tasks with ease, offers decent camera quality for its price, and you're willing to overlook some design shortcomings, the G45 could be the right pick for you."

It handles daily tasks well but struggles with gaming and benchmarking. Alternatives like the iQOO 12 or OnePlus 13R may be better for gamers. The camera is good, but a few minor issues can be fixed via an update. ColorOS 15 is visually engaging but suffers from bloatware, making the interface feel cluttered.

However, the phone has a 4000mAh battery, which is quite small compared to other budget and mid-range smartphones. Despite this, the battery life is good, lasting almost 24 hours with light usage. The phone supports 25W charging, which is relatively low, and unfortunately, it doesn't include a charger in the box. Regarding the camera, the phone boasts a 50MP primary camera, a 10MP telephoto camera, and a 12MP ultra-wide camera on the rear. The primary and telephoto cameras perform well, but the ultra-wide camera still lacks autofocus. Low-light photography is decent but can sometimes be grainy.

The front camera performs adequately, but the rear camera doesn't quite impress.

It performs well for casual gaming and everyday tasks, with a snappy, bloat-free software experience. Camera performance shines in good lighting, but low-light and selfies need some improvement.

The phone also sports an excellent SAMOLED display with a 120Hz refresh rate, making it ideal for content consumption. It also works well in bright sunlight. But the audio quality does leave one wanting, especially when watching TV shows. The battery life and performance are also adequate for most users.

What stands out is the design, the general performance, the camera, and the large battery size. The user interface is also simple.     But then Motorola is restricting Android updates to just one more version. Is this the best display one can get on a phone? No, nor is it a device centred around gaming. But then, given the price, it ticks some of the more important boxes quite nicely. If one goes by pricing, its biggest rival would be the Realme P1, which has more to offer on the gaming front.

Powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 7 Gen 1 AE SoC, this phone handles everyday tasks effortlessly. However, you might experience heating issues during intensive gaming sessions with titles like BGMI and Call of Duty: Mobile. While the camera performs well overall, the portrait photography feature may disappoint some users. Considering all these aspects, the Motorola Edge 50 attempts to cater to a wide range of user needs. However, compromises may be necessary for photography and fast charging."

However, be prepared for lacklustre performance especially on high-end games, as the processor is based on a three-year-old architecture.

The 15 Pro Max will provide consistent results, with crisp details and ample dynamic range. The smartphone is powered by the Apple A17 Pro chip, making it a smooth operator. Whether scrolling through social media apps, casual browsing, texting, or playing intensive games, everything feels effortless. Sure, the phone might heat but a quick software update should sort that out. Battery life is impressive, providing nearly a full day of use, although charging speeds could be faster. And with iOS 17, customization options abound, allowing you to tailor the device to your liking. So, if you're willing to splash the cash, the iPhone 15 Pro Max is where it's at."

Intensive games frequently crash, disrupting the experience, whereas casual games run fairly well with only minor lags and stutters. On the back, the phone has an 8MP primary camera and a 2MP depth camera, while the front houses a 5MP selfie camera. The image quality is satisfactory for basic needs. The device boasts a 5000mAh battery, which is impressive and offers long battery life. It runs on ColorOS 13, based on Android 13, right out of the box.

The OPPO K3 comes with just two rear-facing sensors. OPPO also needs to improve ColorOS to add more customizability and cohesiveness. If you don't care too much about ultrawide-angle cameras, you should definitely consider the OPPO K3."

It sports a 6.5-inch display but only supports HD+ screen resolution without any high refresh rate. The hardware delivers basic performance but not good enough for heavy tasks like gaming. You get 128GB storage, which is further expandable but 4GB RAM might feel limiting. The 50MP primary camera shoots decent photos, but the other sensors are average. The 6,000mAh battery offers long backup with 18W charging speed which takes a long time to charge. Buy the Narzo 50A if you need a phone for basic daily use."
